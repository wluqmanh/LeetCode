## Problem Description
> Given an integer `x`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

```python
# Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

# Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        if x < 0:
            return False

        rev = 0
        y = x

        while y:
            rev = rev * 10 + y % 10
            y //= 10

        return rev == x
```
- Time complexity: O(log<sub>10</sub> x) â€“ Iterating through the entire integer variable digit by digit, time complexity is O(log<sub>10</sub> n).
Log<sub>10</sub> because dealing with integers which are base 10.
- Space complexity: O(1)
