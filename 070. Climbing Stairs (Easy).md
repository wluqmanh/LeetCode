## Problem Description
> You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?



```python
Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```
## Solution
### <u>Solution #1: One-Dimensional DP</u>
Initialize two variables that represent the base cases:
`prev_step` represents the number of ways to reach the step before the current one 
`curr_step` represents the number of ways to reach the current step. Initially set to 1 because there's 1 way to be at the first step.
		
Loop for each step up to the nth step

At each step, the number of ways to reach the current step is the sum of the ways to reach the previous two steps.

After finishing the loop, `curr_step` contains the total number of ways to reach the nth step.
```python
class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        prev_step = 0
        curr_step = 1
        
        for _ in range(n):
            prev_step, curr_step = curr_step, prev_step + curr_step
            
        return curr_step
```

Alternative form
```python
prev1 = 1  # dp[i - 1]
prev2 = 1  # dp[i - 2]

for _ in range(2, n + 1):
    dp = prev1 + prev2
    prev2 = prev1
    prev1 = dp
```
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

### <u>Solution #2: Two-Dimensional DP</u>

```python
class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
	# dp[i] := the number of ways to climb to the i-th stair
    dp = [1, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
      dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]

    return dp[n]
```

`dp = [1, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)` initializes a DP array where:
- The first two values (`dp[0]` and `dp[1]`) are set to `1` (base cases).
- The remaining `n - 1` values (`dp[2]` to `dp[n]`) are initialized to `0` (to be filled later).

1. `[1, 1]` (Base Cases)
- `dp[0] = 1`: There is 1 way to stay on the ground (do nothing).
- `dp[1] = 1`: There is 1 way to climb 1 stair (take a single step).

 2. `[0] * (n - 1)` (Remaining Stairs)
- Create an array of `n - 1` zeros (`[0, 0, ..., 0]`).
- These zeros will later be replaced with the correct number of ways for stairs `2` to `n`.

3. Combine both parts (`[1, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)`)
- Concatenate the two lists:
    - `[1, 1]` (for `dp[0]` and `dp[1]`)
    - `[0, 0, ..., 0]` (for `dp[2]` to `dp[n]`).
- Final DP array: `[1, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (length = `n + 1`).
