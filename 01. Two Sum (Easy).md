## Problem Description

> Given an array of <u>integers</u> `nums` and an <u>integer</u> `target`, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
> Assume each input has _exactly one solution_, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

```python
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]  
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```
## Solution
### <u>Solution #1: Brute Force</u>
Iterate through entire list. For each element, iterate through remaining elements to find a pair that sums up to `target`.
```python
class Solution(object):
  def twoSum(self, nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)): # i+1 to avoid repeating elements
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
    return []
```
- Time complexity: O(n²) – Two-layer nested loop.
- Space complexity: O(1) – Doesn’t need additional data structures, so space complexity is constant.
### <u>Solution #2: Two-Pass Hash Table</u>
[[Programming_Coding]]
Use a dictionary to reduce time complexity.
First, add each element & its index to a dictionary. Then, iterate through array again to check if each element’s complement (target — element) exists in the dictionary.

```python
class Solution(object):
  def twoSum(self, nums, target):
    num_dict = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        num_dict[num] = i
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if (complement in num_dict) and (num_dict[complement] != i):
            return [i, num_dict[complement]]
    return []
```
- Time complexity: O(n) – Insertion & lookup time for a hash map is O(1) on average, so overall time complexity for traversing the array once is O(n). Even though array is traversed twice, time complexity remains O(n) as <mark style="background: #706200A6;">these operations are sequential, not nested</mark>. 
- Space complexity: O(n) – Hash map used to store array elements & indices. Space required for hash map grows linearly with number of elements in array.

### Solution #3: One-Pass Hash Table
Hash table approach but only one iteration through array.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
      num_dict = {}
      for i, num in enumerate(nums):
          complement = target - num
          if complement in num_dict:
            return [num_dict[complement], i]
          num_dict[num] = i
      return []
```
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)
