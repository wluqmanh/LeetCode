## Problem Description
> Integer arrays `nums1` & `nums2` are sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` & `n` represent the number of elements in `nums1` & `nums2` respectively.
**Merge** `nums1` & `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

> The final sorted array shouldn’t be returned via function, but instead _stored inside array_ `nums1`.
To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

```python
# Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

# Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

# Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

```
## Solution
Use two pointers `i` & `j` pointing to the end of two arrays, and a pointer `k` pointing to the end of the merged array.

The two elements at the end of the two arrays `nums1&2` are compared, and the larger one is moved to the end of the `merged array`. Then, move the pointer one step forward and repeat this process until the two pointers reach the start of the arrays.
```python
class Solution(object):
    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):
        k = m + n - 1
        i, j = m - 1, n - 1
        while j >= 0:
            if i >= 0 and nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
                nums1[k] = nums1[i]
                i -= 1
            else:
                nums1[k] = nums2[j]
                j -= 1
            k -= 1
```
- Time complexity: O(m + n) – `m` & `n` are the length of two arrays.
- Space complexity: O(1)
