## Problem Description
> Given a string `s` containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '\[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

> An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.


```python
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```
## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        valid_pairs = {'()', '[]', '{}'}
      
        for char in s:
            if char in '({[':
                stack.append(char)
            elif not stack or stack.pop() + char not in valid_pairs:
                return False
				
        return not stack
```
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)
